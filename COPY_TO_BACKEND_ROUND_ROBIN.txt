Hi Backend Team!

I need to implement automatic ticket assignment with round-robin algorithm.

📖 READ THIS FIRST:
👉 ROUND_ROBIN_TICKET_ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT.md (Complete implementation guide with code examples)

📊 FOR REFERENCE:
👉 DASHBOARD_USERS_TABLE_REFERENCE.md (Database structure and queries)

SUMMARY OF WHAT'S NEEDED:

1. DATABASE CHANGES:
   - Add `assigned_to` column to tickets table
   - Create `ticket_assignment_tracker` table
   - Add assignment statistics to dashboard_users

2. IMPLEMENT:
   - Round-robin assignment algorithm
   - Auto-assign tickets on creation
   - Email notification to assigned agent
   - API endpoints for manual reassignment

3. LOGIC:
   - Get eligible users (support + developer roles, approved, active)
   - Rotate through users in order
   - Update assignment tracker
   - Notify agent via email

ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours

Everything you need is in the ROUND_ROBIN_TICKET_ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT.md file!

Let me know if you have questions!
