Hi! I need you to add two public API endpoints to our ticket system.

Please read and implement everything in this file:
👉 BACKEND_PROMPT.md

For detailed specifications, also check:
👉 CUSTOMER_PORTAL_BACKEND.md

Summary:
- Create GET /api/public/ticket/:ticketId (for status lookup)
- Create POST /api/public/complaint (for escalation complaints)
- Add new 'complaints' database table
- Implement rate limiting
- Send emails to admin and customer
- Add security measures

The frontend is already done and waiting for these APIs.

Estimated time: 3-5 hours

Let me know if you have questions!
